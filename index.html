        <p>
            My name is Fawwaz Yasirah, 

            i am a student of telkom university. 

            I possess a strong inclination
            towards the field of informatics,
            with a particular focus on

            back-end development and Game
            Development . 


            My enthusiasm for programming is
            unwavering, as I am intrigued by
            the underlying mechanisms that
            power the software and
            applications we encounter in our
            daily lives. This has led me to
            pursue programming education at
            Telkom University. Presently, I am
            actively seeking an environment
            that can fuel rapid growth in my
            programming abilities
